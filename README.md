# n-EDO Automatic Composer
## The project is currently a mess
The project hit its initial goal so i decided to upload it, but it's quite messy.
I'm not sure about the copyight issues that might emerge by putting amen break slices here, I'll keep an eye on that.

Also, the documentation is non-existent for now and the code is messy and mostly uncommented. The few comments and labels are in mixed language (some in italian, some in english). As stated, it's a mess. If you want to work or have fun with it, good luck.

## What does this patch do?
It generates a breakbeat you can control the randomness of with the parameter beat_randomness;
It generates a harmony in triads with respects to the EDO scale chosen;
It generates a melody in the same fashion.
You can control the BPM, the beat randomness, the EDO, and mix the four channels (amen break, synthesized drums, harmony and melody) and the master separately. You can also control the master frequency but it resets the melody envelope, i'll have to look into that.
Finally, you can start and stop the whole thing via the sequencer cotnrol toggle.
